Abstract:
jmpi is a 100% Java-based implementation of the message-passing interface (MPI-1) standard jmpi comes with an efficient and effective MPI implementation in Java and supports a user-friendly Java application programming interface (API) for MPI. We present the implementation details and give some early communication benchmark performance results on a cluster of SUN UltraSparc workstations.
