Abstract

Application development for distributed-computing “Grids” can benefit from tools that variously hide or enable application-level management of critical aspects of the heterogeneous environment. As part of an investigation of these issues, we have developed MPICH-G2, a Grid-enabled implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) that allows a user to run MPI programs across multiple computers, at the same or different sites, using the same commands that would be used on a parallel computer. This library extends the Argonne MPICH implementation of MPI to use services provided by the Globus Toolkit for authentication, authorization, resource allocation, executable staging, and I/O, as well as for process creation, monitoring, and control. Various performance-critical operations, including startup and collective operations, are configured to exploit network topology information. The library also exploits MPI constructs for performance management; for example, the MPI communicator construct is used for application-level discovery of, and adaptation to, both network topology and network quality-of-service mechanisms. We describe the MPICH-G2 design and implementation, present performance results, and review application experiences, including record-setting distributed simulations.

Nicholas T. Karonis received a B.S. in finance and a B.S. in computer science from Northern Illinois University in 1985, an M.S. in computer science from Northern Illinois University in 1987, and a Ph.D. in computer science from Syracuse University in 1992. He spent summers from 1981 to 1991 as a student at Argonne National Laboratory, where he worked on the p4 message-passing library, automated reasoning, and genetic sequence alignment. From 1991 to 1995 he worked on the control system at Argonne's Advanced Photon Source and from 1995 to 1996 for the Computing Division at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. From 1996 to 2002 he held the position of assistant professor and is now (since 2002) an associate professor of computer science at Northern Illinois University. Since 1996 he has also been a resident associate guest of Argonne's Mathematics and Computer Science Division where he has been a member of the Globus Project. His current research interest is message-passing systems in computational Grids.

Brian Toonen received his B.S. in computer science from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh in 1993, and his M.S. in computer science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1997. He is a senior scientific programmer with the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory. Brian's research interests include parallel and distributed computing, operating systems, and networking. He is currently working with the MPICH team to create a portable, high-performance implementation of the MPI-2 standard. Prior to joining the MPICH team, he was a senior developer for the Globus Project.

Ian Foster received his B.Sc. (Hons I) at the University of Canterbury in 1979 and his Ph.D. from Imperial College, London, in 1988. He is a senior scientist and associate director of the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory and professor of computer science at the University of Chicago. He has published four books and over 150 papers and technical reports. He co-leads the Globus Project, which provides protocols and services used by industrial and academic distributed computing projects worldwide. He co-founded the influential Global Grid Forum and co-edited the book “The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure”.
