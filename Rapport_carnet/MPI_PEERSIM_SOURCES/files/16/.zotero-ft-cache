Abstract:
This research work explains different aspects of PeerSim simulator used to create nodes and simulate peer to peer overlay network topology generation protocols. PeerSimhas been tested over various protocols specifically designed to work with a heterogeneous environment and its efficiency and scalability is evaluated considering different properties of the nodes and network. These protocols are used to introduce clusters for efficient resource retrieval, behaviour of cooperation and security. PeerSim has proven to be a very efficient and scalable test bed for the generation of nodes through gossip based protocol and implementing different protocols on the nodes generated. The aim of this paper is to provide a detailed description and evaluation of PeerSimthrough study of already implemented protocols, for the researchers working in the field of P2P networking.

I. Introduction

In last few years the research and development area has explored a new dimension to study different modules and algorithms. This study has mainly focused on simulation based deductions and results. This research paper mainly focuses on the development of different protocols in heterogeneous environment of peer-to-peer (P2P) network through PeerSim. PeerSim is a simulator used to develop a non-hierarchical graph for the implementation of different architectures in peer-to-peer networks. The basic idea behind this research paper is to enhance different aspects of PeerSim in order to evaluate its efficiency and scalability for different architectures.
